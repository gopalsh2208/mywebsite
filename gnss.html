        Why I Want To Become Programmer?
        </h1>
        <p>Computer programming is one of the most flexible tools that we can have at our disposal. Not only can 
            we learn to do things that are pretty amazing, but we can also, sometimes, manage to perform the 
            impossible. Anyone that uses a computer, a smartphone, even a key that remotely unlocks our car door
             is using some form of computer programming and our life already depends on programming to a certain
              extent. For the vast majority of people in todayï¿½s digital world, their lives are already being run
               and ruled by software so why not learn to program and get involved, create our own programs to do
                what we want them to do?</p>
